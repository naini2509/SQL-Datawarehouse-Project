**SQL Data Warehouse Project | End-to-End ETL Architecture**
Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a complete Data Warehouse pipeline using Microsoft SQL Server.
It simulates CRM and ERP data integration through a Bronze â†’ Silver â†’ Gold layered architecture, emphasizing data quality, transformation, and reporting readiness.

The project showcases advanced SQL skills in data ingestion, cleansing, aggregation, and validation, following industry-standard best practices.

Technologies Used
SQL Server / Azure SQL Database

T-SQL (Stored Procedures, DDL, DML, Testing)

CSV Files (Source system simulation)

Project Objectives
Ingest structured data from multiple source systems (CRM and ERP).

Apply data quality checks to ensure consistency, accuracy, and completeness.

Transform raw data into cleaned, standardized formats.

Aggregate key business metrics for analytics and reporting.

Build a scalable warehouse structure ready for BI tools.

Key Components
Layer	Purpose
Bronze	Raw data ingestion with minimal transformations.
Silver	Cleaned, deduplicated, and standardized business data.
Gold	Aggregated, analytics-ready datasets for reporting.

Process Workflow
Database Initialization
Setup schema and structure using init_database.sql.

Bronze Layer

Create Bronze tables: bronze/ddl_bronze.sql

Load raw CRM and ERP data: bronze/proc_load_bronze.sql

Silver Layer

Create Silver tables: silver/ddl_silver.sql

Transform and cleanse data: silver/proc_load_silver.sql

Gold Layer

Create Gold tables: gold/ddl_gold.sql

Aggregate metrics for business reporting.

Data Quality Assurance

Validate data at Silver and Gold stages using tests/quality_checks_silver.sql and tests/quality_checks_gold.sql.

Business Problems Addressed
Data Consistency: Standardized customer, product, and transaction records.

Inventory Management: Simulated ERP stock updates post-sales.

Revenue Tracking: Prepared Gold tables with revenue, profit, and trend metrics.

Anomaly Detection: Built-in quality checks for missing data and outliers.

Dataset Summary
Source	Files	Description
CRM	cust_info.csv, prd_info.csv, sales_details.csv	Customer profiles, product catalog, and sales transactions.
ERP	CUST_AZ12.csv, LOC_A101.csv, PX_CAT_G1V2.csv	Customer master records, location details, and product categories.

Highlights
ðŸ“‚ End-to-End ETL Process designed and built fully with SQL.

ðŸ§¹ Comprehensive Data Cleansing to prepare trusted datasets.
