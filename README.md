**SQL Data Warehouse Project | End-to-End ETL Architecture**


🔹**Overview**:

➔ This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a complete Data Warehouse pipeline using Microsoft SQL Server.
It simulates CRM and ERP data integration through a Bronze → Silver → Gold layered architecture, emphasizing data quality, transformation, and reporting readiness.

➔ The project showcases advanced SQL skills in data ingestion, cleansing, aggregation, and validation, following industry-standard best practices.



🔹**Technologies Used**:

▸ SQL Server / Azure SQL Database

▸ T-SQL (Stored Procedures, DDL, DML, Testing)

▸ CSV Files (Source system simulation)



🔹**Project Objectives**:

▸ Ingest structured data from multiple source systems (CRM and ERP).

▸ Apply data quality checks to ensure consistency, accuracy, and completeness.

▸ Transform raw data into cleaned, standardized formats.

▸ Aggregate key business metrics for analytics and reporting.

▸ Build a scalable warehouse structure ready for BI tools.



🔹**Key Components**:

| Layer  | Purpose                                                |
| :----- | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| Bronze | Raw data ingestion with minimal transformations.       |
| Silver | Cleaned, deduplicated, and standardized business data. |
| Gold   | Aggregated, analytics-ready datasets for reporting.    |



🔹**Process Workflow**:

➔ **Database Initialization**:

Setup schema and structure using init_database.sql.

➔ **Bronze Layer**:

Create Bronze tables: bronze/ddl_bronze.sql

Load raw CRM and ERP data: bronze/proc_load_bronze.sql

➔ **Silver Layer**:

Create Silver tables: silver/ddl_silver.sql

Transform and cleanse data: silver/proc_load_silver.sql

➔ **Gold Layer**:

Create Gold tables: gold/ddl_gold.sql

Aggregate metrics for business reporting.

➔ **Data Quality Assurance**:

Validate data at Silver and Gold stages using tests/quality_checks_silver.sql and tests/quality_checks_gold.sql.



🔹**Business Problems Addressed**:

**Data Consistency**: Standardized customer, product, and transaction records.

**Inventory Management**: Simulated ERP stock updates post-sales.

**Revenue Tracking**: Prepared Gold tables with revenue, profit, and trend metrics.

**Anomaly Detection**: Built-in quality checks for missing data and outliers.



🔹**Dataset Summary**:

| Source | Files                                                | Description                                                        |
| :----- | :--------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CRM    | `cust_info.csv`, `prd_info.csv`, `sales_details.csv` | Customer profiles, product catalog, and sales transactions.        |
| ERP    | `CUST_AZ12.csv`, `LOC_A101.csv`, `PX_CAT_G1V2.csv`   | Customer master records, location details, and product categories. |




🔹**Highlights**:

▸ End-to-End ETL Process designed and built fully with SQL.

▸ Comprehensive Data Cleansing to prepare trusted datasets.

▸ Business-Ready Outputs for seamless BI integration.

▸ Data Validation at multiple layers to ensure integrity.



🔹**Future Enhancements**:

▸ Enable real-time data ingestion using streaming architecture.

▸ Integrate predictive analytics for revenue forecasting.

▸ Expand the model to additional business domains (logistics, finance).



🔹**About**:

➔ This project reflects a real-world Data Engineering and ETL scenario using SQL technologies, demonstrating best practices in data ingestion, cleaning, transformation, validation, and reporting preparation.

➔ It serves as a strong portfolio project for roles in Data Engineering, Business Intelligence, and Analytics Engineering.
